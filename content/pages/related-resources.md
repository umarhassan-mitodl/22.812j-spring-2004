Bunn, Matthew. [_The Next Wave: Urgently Needed New Steps to Control Warheads and Fissile Material_](http://belfercenter.org/publication/next-wave-urgently-needed-new-steps-control-warheads-and-fissile-material). Washington, DC and Cambridge, MA: Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, March 2000.  
A paper by Matthew Bunn, Harvard University Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.

Bunn, Matthew, Oleg Bukharin, and Kenneth N. Luongo_._ [_Renewing the Partnership: Recommendations for Accelerated Action to Secure Nuclear Material in the Former Soviet Union_](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/renewing-partnership-recommendations-accelerated-action-secure-nuclear-material-former). Princeton, NJ: Russian American Nuclear Security Advisory Council, August 2000.  
A report specifically on how to strengthen the program to improve security and accounting of nuclear material in Russia.

"A Report Card on the Department of Energy's Nonproliferation Programs with Russia." Secretary of Energy Advisory Board, January 10, 2001 (approved by the SEAB on January 18, 2001). ([PDF](https://www.hsdl.org/?abstract&did=2888))  
The recent report on DOE's Russia nonproliferation programs by a task force of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board (which recommends a $30B 10-year effort to address the security risks).

Bunn, Matthew, and John P. Holdren. "[Managing Military Uranium and Plutonium in the United States and the Former Soviet Union](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.energy.22.1.403)." _Annual Review of Energy and the Environment_ 22 (1997): 403-486.  
The opening sections (pp. 403-419) of this chapter by Matthew Bunn and John Holdren in _Annual Review of Energy and the Environment_ provide a discussion of which isotopes are weapons-usable, the reactor-grade vs. weapon-grade issue, how much Pu and HEU are needed for a bomb, how much of these materials exists in the world, etc.
